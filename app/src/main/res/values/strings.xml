In October 2009, the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) was established by a merger of Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe GmbH and Universität Karlsruhe (TH). The KIT pursues both the mission of a university with teaching and research tasks and the mission
of a national research center of the Helmholtz Association conducting program-oriented provident research. Within these missions, KIT is operating along the three strategic fields of action of research, teaching, and innovation.
KIT’s activities are organized in five divisions: Biology, Chemistry, and Process Engineering; Informatics, Economics, and Society; Mechanical and Electrical Engineering; Natural and Built Environ­ment; Physics and Mathematics. These divisions pool the research, education, and innovation activities of the affiliated institutes. The divisions also cover the work accomplished by the KIT depart­ments and under the program-oriented funding programs of the Helmholtz Association.
With about 9400 employees, including 6000 staff members in the science and education sector, and 24,500 students, KIT is one of the biggest research and education institutions in Europe.
The merger in KIT is the logical continuation of a long-lasting close cooperation of two research and education institutions having a rich tradition. Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe was founded in 1956 as Nuclear Reactor Building and Operation Company and has turned into a multidisciplinary large-scale research center of the Helmholtz Association working on research programs in natural sciences and engineering. Universität Karlsruhe was founded in 1825 as Polytechnical College and has become a modern location of research and education in natural sciences, engineering, economics, and the humanities.\nSource: KIT at a Glance Brochure\n</string>
